Please note the following to be able to run the API properly:

1- Make sure to install the requirements libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt).
2- Before trying to run the 'main.py', you need to run 'download_model_and_tokenizer.py' to load the fine-tuned model uploaded on HuggingFace.
3- Data Analysis and Training scripts are done using Jupyter notebook, please refer to 'data_analysis_trials.ipynb' and 'training_DistilBERT.ipynb' respectively.
4- Once the 'main.py' is running on the background, you will then be able to call the API locally ("http://127.0.0.1:5000/") or run the 'test.py' on another terminal.
